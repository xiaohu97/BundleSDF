# Abstract
We present a near real-time method for 6-DoF tracking of an unknown object from a monocular RGBD video sequence, while simultaneously performing neural 3D reconstruction of the object. Our method works for arbitrary rigid objects, even when visual texture is largely absent. The object is assumed to be segmented in the first frame only. No additional information is required, and no assumption is made about the interaction agent. Key to our method is a Neural Object Field that is learned concurrently with a pose graph optimization process in order to robustly accumulate information into a consistent 3D representation capturing both geometry and appearance. A dynamic pool of posed memory frames is automatically maintained to facilitate communication between these threads. Our approach handles challenging sequences with large pose changes, partial and full occlusion, untextured surfaces, and specular highlights. We show results on HO3D, YCBInEOAT, and BEHAVE datasets, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

# Data download
- Download pretrained [weights of segmentation network](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MEZvjbBdNAOF7pXcq6XPQduHeXB50VTc/view?usp=share_link), and put it under
`./BundleTrack/XMem/saves/XMem-s012.pth`

- Download pretrained [weights of LoFTR outdoor_ds.ckpt](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xu2Pq6mZT5hmFgiYMBT9Zt8h1yO-3SIp), and put it under
`./BundleTrack/LoFTR/weights/outdoor_ds.ckpt`

- Download HO3D data. We provide the augmented data that you can download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wk-HZDvUExyUrRn7us4WWEbHnnFHgOAX?usp=share_link). Then download YCB-Video object models from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-1m7qMMyUHYLhaRiQBbsSRMt5dMRX4jD/view?usp=share_link). Finally, make sure the structure is like below, and update your root path of `HO3D_ROOT` at the top of `BundleTrack/scripts/data_reader.py`
  ```
  HO3D_v3
    ├── evaluation
    ├── models
    └── masks_XMem
  ```


# Docker/Environment setup
- Build the docker image (this only needs to do once and can take some time).
```
cd docker
docker build --network host -t nvcr.io/nvidian/bundlesdf .
```

- Start a docker container the first time
```
cd docker && bash run_container.sh

# Inside docker container, compile the packages which are machine dependent
bash build.sh
```

# Quick start without Docker
The commands below are the shortest local workflow for a conda environment. On this machine, the tested environment name is `bundlesdf`.

```bash
conda activate bundlesdf
cd /path/to/BundleSDF
```

If you want to convert Intel RealSense `.bag` recordings, make sure `pyrealsense2` is available in the same environment:

```bash
pip install pyrealsense2
```

LoFTR weights are required before running `run_custom.py`. The download folder should contain at least `outdoor_ds.ckpt` under:

```text
BundleTrack/LoFTR/weights/
```

# RealSense .bag workflow
`run_custom.py` expects an extracted dataset folder, not a `.bag` file. For RealSense recordings, first convert the bag into aligned RGB-D frames:

```bash
python convert_realsense_bag.py \
  --bag /path/to/sequence.bag \
  --output_dir /path/to/sequence
```

This writes:

```text
/path/to/sequence
  ├── rgb/
  ├── depth/
  ├── masks/
  └── cam_K.txt
```

Notes:
- `depth/` is saved as aligned `uint16` depth in millimeters.
- `masks/` are placeholder valid-depth masks by default. Replace them with object masks for best tracking/reconstruction quality.
- The output directory must be empty or not exist before conversion.

# Run on your custom data
- Prepare your RGBD video folder as below (also refer to the example milk data). You can find an [example milk data here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1akutk_Vay5zJRMr3hVzZ7s69GT4gxuWN/view?usp=share_link) for testing.
```
root
  ├──rgb/    (PNG files)
  ├──depth/  (PNG files, stored in mm, uint16 format. Filename same as rgb)
  ├──masks/       (PNG files. Filename same as rgb. 0 is background. Else is foreground)
  └──cam_K.txt   (3x3 intrinsic matrix, use space and enter to delimit)
```

Due to license issues, we are not able to include [XMem](https://github.com/hkchengrex/XMem) in this codebase for running segmentation online. If you are interested in doing so, please download the code separately and add a wrapper in `segmentation_utils.py`.

- Run your RGBD video (specify the video_dir and your desired output path). There are 3 steps. Note we assume the max relevant depth in the demo data <1. If this is not the case for you, change it [here](https://github.com/NVlabs/BundleSDF/blob/master/BundleTrack/config_ho3d.yml#L16)
```
# 1) Run joint tracking and reconstruction.
# For precomputed masks in masks/, use --use_segmenter 0.
python run_custom.py --mode run_video --video_dir /path/to/sequence --out_folder /path/to/output --use_segmenter 0 --use_gui 0 --debug_level 2

# 2) Run global refinement post-processing to refine the mesh
python run_custom.py --mode global_refine --video_dir /path/to/sequence --out_folder /path/to/output

# 3) (Optional) If you want to draw the oriented bounding box to visualize the pose, similar to our demo
python run_custom.py --mode draw_pose --out_folder /path/to/output
```

- Example on this machine:
```
python convert_realsense_bag.py --bag /home/ustczxh/realsense/20260319_184534.bag --output_dir /home/ustczxh/realsense/20260319_184534
python run_custom.py --mode run_video --video_dir /home/ustczxh/realsense/20260319_184534 --out_folder /home/ustczxh/realsense/output --use_gui 0
python run_custom.py --mode global_refine --video_dir /home/ustczxh/realsense/20260319_184534 --out_folder /home/ustczxh/realsense/output
```

- Finally the results will be dumped in the `out_folder`. Common outputs include:
- `ob_in_cam/` for tracked poses
- `mesh_cleaned.obj` for the cleaned geometry
- `textured_mesh.obj` for the textured reconstruction mesh
